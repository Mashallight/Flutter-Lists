# MAD Assignment 1 : Wordle Daily Answers App (Using Lists)

Building a simple app for using a List in Flutter 

## For this assignment, I will create:
   1. An object with hard coded list of answers for the game wordle, eg: Black, Arise, Lamps, Shawl, Scare
   3. A textbox widget to enter a choice of 1,2,3,or ...
   4. A button to access the list and display the content of the list depending on what was chosen on the textbox. 
      
      So if 1 is entered in the textbox, then, it will display the first day's answer i.e Black
